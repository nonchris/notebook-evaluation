# notebook-evaluation
A script for easier evaluating of juypter notebooks for edv

I just wrote this in one session, because I wanted to see if I'm able to correct the jupyter notebooks without using jupyter.  
Tried to automate as much of the process as possible.  
This is meant for correcting notebooks from 'edv f√ºr physiker' a physics / programming module at the university of bonn.
